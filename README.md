This is the first project of the #20ProjectsChallenge, a challenge I found on Twitter. Despite that perhaps some of them are quite basic, I thought it would be interesting to develop them in order to keep practicing and  facing new problems to solve. I will post all these projects with the hashtag that I already used, to make it easier to identify which one is part of the challenge.
